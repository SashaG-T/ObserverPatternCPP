# Observer Pattern For C++
A single header C++ Observer Pattern framework.

Check out the **main.cpp** file for a small demo of how to use it.

### Including
Simply include **Event.h** into your project.

This was written and tested only using Mingw.
I'm nearly certain some porting will be needed for VS.
